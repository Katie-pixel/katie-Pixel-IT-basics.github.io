<h2> What Is Required For The Job? </h2>

<p> My ideal role is linked above and screenshots provided. It is a middle management role, that involves managing the implementation of software solutions to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of a retail business. This role works closely with IT professionals, while approaching transformation from a business process perspective. Working cross stream and alongside IT, this role involves managing a team of process experts to effectively improve upon legacy business processes with the support of new technology. <br>

The required skills for this role are an depth understanding of supply chain business processes, as well as a working knowledge of SAP Software. Strong management skills focused around leadership, mentoring and problem solving need to be partnered with the ability to critically analyse business problems and manage a dynamic and challenging workload to achieve deadlines. <br>

Skills that really benefit a person in this role is a sound technical knowledge, not just around SAP software but other innovative technology solutions and technical language in general. The role requires frequent meetings with IT stakeholders inside and external to the business, so these skills will ensure you don’t get ‘lost’ in highly technical meetings, requiring you to defer to an IT counterpart for ‘translations’. </p>

<h2> My Plan To Get The Job </h2>

<p> This technical knowledge is the biggest gap that I see in my current skill set, versus the requirements for my ideal role. While I will always strive to improve my leadership skills, I have confidence in my knowledge of business processes, my critical skills and my ability to manage complex workloads. 

I aim to gain a better technical understanding through further experience in my current role, and completing IT related electives in my studies. Then, upon completion of my business degree I will be an ideal candidate for this role.
