<h1> Project Idea </h1>
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> The concept for this Project Idea is fun and addictive online game that will reflect the fun of learning IT for the first time, as well as my beginner levels skills in the field. The basic premise for the game is language learning, in a fun, simulation environment. <br>
<br>
The motivation for this project is my own personal struggle with learning a second language, for the first time as an adult. I find fun activities, like those directed at children, as a good way to learn and remember language so I have wondered why there are not more games that promote language learning and retention. <br>
<br>
Considering the enormous download numbers of language apps; Duo Lingo had 8.6 million downloads in February 2022, I believe there is a strong market for a product such as this. <br>
<br> 
</p>
<h2> Description Of The Concept </h2>
<p> The proposed game is an educational tool for people learning a second language. It will have a similar learning style as infectious Apps like ‘Duo Lingo’ where the learner learns everyday phrases that are immediately applicable in the real world. The key difference in this idea to other language apps is the concept of play. <br>
Here it is introduced a role playing aspect similar to ‘The Sims’ where the user chooses their direction and goes about their day or activity. During the selected play they come across people and scenarios that require them to: <br>
-	 listen and comprehend the language they are learning <br>
-	Construct sentences in the language they are learning <br>
-	Speak out loud in the language they are learning <br>

Activities the games character can choose to do are everyday tasks that are relevant for a language learner. Going to a shop, going to school, going to a party and meeting new people. The fun comes for the gamer in creating their own avatar as they wish, and creating whatever adventures or misadventures they please. <br>
<br>
The game should include a feature that enables friends to play online together in the simulation environment and to help one another with language. <br>
<br>
There should be awards relating to success in the fields of: <br> 
-	learning new words<br>
-	sentence construction and grammar<br>
-	helping friends with their language mistakes <br>
-	regular play<br>
-	reaching levels of proficiency in the given language<br>

The game would aim to be developed in a few main languages with the view to expand the language options in future developments. </p>

<h2> Tools And Technologies </h2>

<p>As a reflection of my lack of experience in coding and game development, the project will be developed using software tool Construct 3. <br>
Hardware will be required, in the form of a fast, modern computer and a graphics card.</p>

<h2> Skills Required </h2>

<p> Research shows that coding is a critical skill in game development, along with design skills to develop graphics and animation. I also see a critical capability is to be continuously up to date with innovation in the industry, to ensure your idea is not ‘stale’ before completion. <br>

To acquire the hardware and software needed for this project, substantial capital investment would be required. Although I own a PC that would be sufficient for the project, the cost of a graphics card in my country of residence is high and could mean an investment of more than 750 AUD equivalent. <br>

Considering that I have none of the technical skills required to develop a game it would be a challenging project and would require attention to work with a diverse team of complementing skill base. <br>
 </p>

<h2> Outcome </h2>

<p> If this project was successfully delivered this would be an incredible personal achievement. Evryone enjoys a fun and easy PC and to play a game I have collaborated on developing would see me achieving a new skill and enjoying the learning process.<br>
There is also the potential for a product such as this to really help people to learn a second language in a fun, stress free environment.
